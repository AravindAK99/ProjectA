On these shores, over 500 years ago in 1498, 170 men led by Vasco- da-Gama first stepped onto Kerala. The entire State, especially the Malabar Coast, would never be the same again.</p>
                           <p class="fs-5 fw-light  fst-italic text-lg-start">A visit to Calicut is incomplete without a visit to this legendary site. The spice route flourished through this Beach. A walk in and around the place gives one an idea of itshistorical relevance. The rocks and small hills add to its charm. The nearby shacks are always stocked with excellent local delicacies and tea. Migratory birds can be spotted occasionally as well. Kappad Beach is a truly majestic destination, which will always hold an important place in our history.
