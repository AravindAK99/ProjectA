         <p class="fs-5 lead text-center  ">Kollam is a beautiful place in South India, which fascinates you with its multitude of tourist attractions. Such was the fame of Kollam once as a trade center that everyone from the Romans, Arabs, Chinese, the Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders were clamoring to get their hands on the spices and the cashew crops of the region.</p>
        
         <p class="fs-5 lead text-center ">From Ibn Batuta to Marco Polo, legendary explorers have talked about the prominence of Kollam district for centuries. Blessed with a long coastline, it is the de facto leader of the cashew trade and processing industry in India. It is historically remembered as being among the most important ports which were part of the legendary Spice Trade. 
        </p>
         <p class="fs-5 lead text-center ">Over a third of its surface is covered by the great Ashtamudi Lake, the entrance to the renowned backwaters of Kerala. Get onboard a houseboat and let the beautiful landscape transport you to an age where nature resided in our midst. An eight hour ride via this route to Alappuzha is among the most sought-after and picturesque trips that Kerala has to offer.

            Once known as Quilon, Kollam has a host of other attractions. People love visiting the Ashtamudi Backwaters along with the Thenmala Ecotourism Centre, Palaruvi Waterfalls, Jatayupara and Alumkadavu. The area is home to some of the most ornate temples built in traditional Kerala style. These are important relics of Kollam's glorious past. One can also go and relax at the nearby beaches, namely Kollam, Thirumullavaram and Thangasseri.</p>

    <p class="fs-5 lead text-left ">The traditional Kollam cuisines are Appam, Stew, Fish Moilee, Chilli Garlic Prawns and Fish in shredded coconut which are prepared with locally cultivated aromatic spices that give the authentic taste to Kerala dishes.</p>
    
    <p class="fs-3 text-left text-decoration-underline lead">Best Time To Visit Kollam</p>
    <p class="fs-5 lead text-left ">  November and December (Winter) is the best time to visit Kollam because the temperature is relatively pleasant, humidity is low and there is almost no rainfall to spoil your evening at the beach. It is best to avoid the monsoons. Kollam experiences tropical coastal climate and the temperatures average around 20 to 30 degrees throughout the year. There is frequent rainfall because of the proximity to the ocean and from July to September (returning monsoon) thunderstorms are more common. </p>

The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it, therefore making it among the best tourist spots in Kollam.</p>

It is surrounded by hills on the 3 sides and is the largest source of drinking water for the residents of Kollam. The reason for it being a freshwater source is the presence of larva chaoborus in the water which is responsible of consuming bacteria from the lake water and makes its healthy and fit for drinking. The lake is home for 27 species of freshwater fish. You can do boating and swimming in this lake.</p>
